### 3.1. Exercise 1 : SQL Normalization

The manager of the dinner club would like to manage the information system that assists him to keep track of the dinners
had by members.
Because the manager is not an expert of Information Systems, (s)he uses the following table to store the information.
Please help the manger by using the knowledge of database normal forms.
Save all answers in a text file / MD file.

1. What columns violate 1NF?
2. What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
3. Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.

## 1. Violation of First Normal Form (1NF)

### What Columns Violate 1NF?
First Normal Form (1NF) requires that each column in a table must contain atomic, indivisible values. The following columns violate 1NF:

- **food_code**: This column contains multiple values (e.g., "C1, C2") in a single field, which violates the requirement for atomic values.
- **food_description**: Similarly, this column contains multiple values (e.g., "Curry, Cake") in a single field.

These columns should be split into separate rows or tables to comply with 1NF.

## 2. Recognized Entities

### What Entities Could Be Extracted?
From the given table, we can identify the following entities that can be extracted to create a more normalized database structure:

1. **Member**: Information related to members, such as `member_id`, `member_name`, and `member_address`.
2. **Dinner**: Information related to dinners, such as `dinner_id`, `dinner_date`, and associated member information.
3. **Venue**: Information related to venues, such as `venue_code` and `venue_description`.
4. **Food**: Information related to food items, such as `food_code` and `food_description`.
5. **Dinner_Food**: A junction table to associate dinners with food items, handling the many-to-many relationship between dinners and foods.

## 3. Third Normal Form (3NF) Compliant Solution

### Name All the Tables and Columns for 3NF Compliance
To achieve 3NF compliance, the data can be organized into the following tables:

1. **Member**
   - `member_id` (Primary Key)
   - `member_name`
   - `member_address`

2. **Dinner**
   - `dinner_id` (Primary Key)
   - `dinner_date`
   - `member_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Member.member_id`)
   - `venue_code` (Foreign Key referencing `Venue.venue_code`)

3. **Venue**
   - `venue_code` (Primary Key)
   - `venue_description`

4. **Food**
   - `food_code` (Primary Key)
   - `food_description`

5. **Dinner_Food**
   - `dinner_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Dinner.dinner_id`)
   - `food_code` (Foreign Key referencing `Food.food_code`)

### Explanation:
- **Member Table**: Stores unique member information.
- **Dinner Table**: Stores information about each dinner event, linked to a specific member and venue.
- **Venue Table**: Stores unique information about venues.
- **Food Table**: Stores unique food items.
- **Dinner_Food Table**: Resolves the many-to-many relationship between dinners and food items, allowing multiple food items to be associated with a single dinner.

By organizing the data into these tables, we ensure that the database is in 3NF, eliminating redundancy and ensuring that all dependencies are on the primary keys.
