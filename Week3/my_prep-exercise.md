1- Was your database already in 2NF / 3NF?

Yes, my database design is already in 2NF and 3NF. The tables are well structured, and there are no apparent partial or transitive dependencies.

The table structure is in 1NF, each table has a PK(id)and each column contains atomic values(no repeating groups, no mzing data types,) so NO violation of  the principles of 1NF.

A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and plus if all non -key attributes are fully functional depented on the PK.In my tables like Recipe, Category, Ingredient, and Step all have single primary keys, and their attributes are fully dependent on these keys.

For  3NF , there are no transitive dependencies (attributes depending on other non-key attributes) within my tables.


2- What changes did you have to do to normalize your database?

No significant changes are necessary to achieve 2NF and 3NF. The design is to be properly normalized.


Challenges in Adding Thousands of Recipes to the Database

some possible challanges:

1. Data Integrity and Consistency
solution :using db constraints like FK
2. Performance and Scalability   
solution :indexing
3. Data Duplication and Redundancy   
solution :implemeting unique constraints
4. Data Validation and Quality    
solution : implementing validation checks both at application level and in the db.example: validate preperation time is a positive integer
