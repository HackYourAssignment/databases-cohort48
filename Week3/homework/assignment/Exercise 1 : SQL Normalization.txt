1-What columns violate 1NF?
 -food_code and food_description violate 1NF because they contain multiple values in a single cell (e.g., "C1, C2" and "Curry, Cake").
 -The date formats in dinner_date are inconsistent, which could also be considered a violation, although this is more about data integrity than strict 1NF compliance.

2-What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
 -Members: Represented by member_id, member_name, and member_address.
 -Dinners: Represented by dinner_id and dinner_date.
 -Venues: Represented by venue_code and venue_description.
 -Foods: Represented by food_code and food_description.
 -Attendance: Tracks which members attended which dinners.
 -Dinner-Food Relationship: Tracks which foods were served at each dinner.
